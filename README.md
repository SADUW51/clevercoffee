## Notes
You can find our project website here: [Clever Coffee Website](https://clevercoffee.de).

We recommend you to have a look at our manual here in Github first,
here you can find the german manual: [Link](https://rancilio-pid.github.io/ranciliopid-handbook/)

## What is possible after integrating
 * **NEW** Own web page hosted via the node for setting the PID.
 * **NEW** Transition from steam mode to normal mode optimized.
 * **NEW** MQTT (IoT) support to manipulate all important parameters.
 * Control of the brewing temperature with an accuracy of up to +/- 0,1Â°.
 * Perfectly reach the set temperature within 8 to 12 minutes after switching on (depending on the machine). 
 * Control of the brewing time incl. pre-infusion possible in the expansion stage "full expansion".
 * Brew detection using a sensor with OnlyPID. [read more](https://rancilio-pid.github.io/ranciliopid-handbook/de/customization/brueherkennung.html#konfiguration-der-erkennung).
 * Shot timer adjustable to see the reference time.
 * Integration of a scale function. Documentation in the manual is still pending. 
 * Steam mode with own PID controller and set temperature (in the web interface). 
 * Integration of a water level sensor.
 * Currently 3 designs for the display, possibility to integrate further designs easily (including vertical template)
 * Support for Siliva E machines: trigger with definable interval for a relay to bypass the Eco function
 * Configurable via integrated web interface
 * Data monitoring via Grafana (web-based). 
 * Updates of the PID software are possible wirelessly via WLAN
 * Our PID software is Open Source: free of charge for you and customizable to your personal needs
 * Small footprint, fits easily into most smaller espresso machines
 * The standard wiring of the machine remains and is only extended. The machine can be easily retrofitted after the conversion.
 * Active user community in project chat with fast support
 * Support for 4 years with continuous adjustments

Suggestions for further development of the software are welcome. User input is always welcome and brings the PID forward!
You are welcome to help us together in our mission to make better espresso. 

Thanks to every single supporter!
